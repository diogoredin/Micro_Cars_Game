# Computer Graphics Course Repository

## About
The goal of this project is to develop a game similar to Microcars, released in 1991. The project uses Three.js and allowed us to explore core Computer Graphics concepts. The project is divided into four parts - you can check the progress and description of each part below.

## How to Run the Project
Either online or on localhost using a virtual server program, e.g. SimpleHTTPServer for Python:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Parts
1. [Part 1](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_1)
1.1. Modelling the Car using three.js geometries
1.2. Implementing Car controls and movement
1.3. Implementing Scene Objects (Table, Oranges, Butters and Cheerios)

2. [Part 2](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_2)
2.1. Implementing our own Collision Boxes
2.2. Handling Collisions
2.3. Rotating and giving movement to Oranges
2.4. Implementing Different Cameras (Ortographic -> 1, Perspective -> 2, Car View -> 3)

3. [Part 3](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_3)
3.1. Adding Directional Lighting (on/off -> 'n')
3.2. Adding 6 Candle Lights (on/off -> 'c')
3.3. Allowing Disablement of Light Calculation (on/off -> 'l')
3.4. Changing Materials between Phong and Gourad (phong/gourad -> 'g')
3.5. Replacing Car Geometry with our own Poligons Geometries

4. [Part 4](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_4)
4.1. Modelling a Towel for the Table
4.2. Adding Headlamps to the Car
4.3. Implementing Play/Pause and Pontuation
