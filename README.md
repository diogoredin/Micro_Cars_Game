# Computer Graphics Course Repository

## About
The goal of this project is to develop a game similar to Microcars, released in 1991. The project uses Three.js and allowed us to explore core Computer Graphics concepts. The project is divided into four parts - you can check the progress and description of each part below.

## How to Run the Project
Either online or on localhost using a virtual server program, e.g. SimpleHTTPServer for Python:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Parts
#### [Part 1](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_1)
* Modelling the Car using three.js geometries
* Implementing Car controls and movement
* Implementing Scene Objects (Table, Oranges, Butters and Cheerios)

#### [Part 2](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_2)
* Implementing our own Collision Boxes
* Handling Collisions
* Rotating and giving movement to Oranges
* Implementing Different Cameras (Ortographic -> 1, Perspective -> 2, Car View -> 3)

#### [Part 3](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_3)
* Adding Directional Lighting (on/off -> 'n')
* Adding 6 Candle Lights (on/off -> 'c')
* Allowing Disablement of Light Calculation (on/off -> 'l')
* Changing Materials between Phong and Gourad (phong/gourad -> 'g')
* Replacing Car Geometry with our own Poligons Geometries

#### [Part 4](http://diogoredin.me/CG_project/part_4)
* Modelling a Towel for the Table
* Adding Headlamps to the Car
* Implementing Play/Pause and Pontuation
